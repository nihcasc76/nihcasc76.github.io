    <p>
        The project SURVEYKSHAK, development start in Aug 2015. GIS is becoming an increasingly important tool in environmental management, retail, military, police, tourism and many other spheres of our daily lives.  However GIS COTS software’s are usually very expensive or otherwise limits your freedom to copy, share and modify. When you buy commercial software, you limit your options for the future. With SURVEYKSHAK, we offer an alternative GIS software that is free of cost. You can make as many copies as you like.

    <p>
        SURVEYKSHAK functions as geographic information system (GIS) software, allowing users to analyse and edit spatial information, in addition to composing and exporting graphical maps. GIS stands for ‘Geographical Information System’.
